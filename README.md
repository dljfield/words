## thedebonair/words

This is an implementation of a blog in a more traditonal manner, which is to say it isn't a single page javascript app (like the original attempt at the words blog). This will be enhanced over time.

TODO for v1:
- Deploy to production!
  - Apparently this is a lot harder than I thought, if you want it to go in a subdirectory. Ugh. 

Future versions:
- Refactoring
  - Full test suite to suport this.
- Refined styling
- Posts in markdown
- Live markdown editor
