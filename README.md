## Words-T

The "T" stands for "Traditional". This is an implementation of a blog in a more traditonal manner, which is to say it isn't a single page javascript app. The server-side is doing rendering and all the other stuff. There may be some more complicated javascript in the form of the post editor displaying markdown or something.
