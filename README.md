## Words-T

The "T" stands for "Traditional". This is an implementation of a blog in a more traditonal manner, which is to say it isn't a single page javascript app (like the original attempt at the words blog).

TODO for v1:
- Testing
- Styling

Future versions:
- Refactoring
- Posts in markdown
- Live markdown editor
